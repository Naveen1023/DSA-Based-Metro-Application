# DSA-Based-Metro-Application

• Self Learning project implemented to understand graph’s application in real world scenarios.
• Manual Creation of Graph using Metro Stations as Nodes and estimated distance among them as Edges is done.
• Leveraged Dijkstra Algorithm and Heaps in order to simulate distances between Metro Stations cost/time wise
